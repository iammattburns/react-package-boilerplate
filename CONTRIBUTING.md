### How Can I Contribute?
**Reporting Bugs**
* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/iammattburns/react-package-boilerplate/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/iammattburns/react-package-boilerplate/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and a clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

**Suggesting Enhancements**
* Open a new issue with your suggestion. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the enhancement, its benefits, and perhaps some sample code or ideas on how it could be implemented.

**Pull Requests**
* Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
* If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
* Ensure the test suite passes.
* Make sure your code lints.
* Push to your branch. Submit a pull request to master.

**Coding Conventions**
* Write clear and concise code with meaningful variable/method names.
* Document your code and add comments where necessary.
* Follow the project's coding style and conventions.
* Ensure any new feature or bug fix comes with appropriate tests.

**Using Commit Messages**
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
